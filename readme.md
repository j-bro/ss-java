# SS-Java

**A Java sidescroller game**

SS-Java is a simple 2D space shooter that mixes basic physics in space and a level-based game with obstacles and power-ups. It is easy to pick up and has a simple control scheme. It comes with 5 included levels, as well as an easy to use level creator and editor.

This project was born as our submission for an integrative project for our last semester in Computer Science & Math. In this framework, we attempted to integrate concepts we learned in our physics courses (kinematics, torque, intertia, equilibrium, Newton's Laws, etc.)

The game is in its final form for the assignment (v0.1.0).

## Requirements
- Java 6.0 or greater

SS-Java was built using the awesome [libGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com) multi-platform OpenGL library.

The physics engine used is the Java port of [Box2D](https://code.google.com/p/box2d/), included in libGDX.

Aur√©lien Ribbon's [Universal Tween Engine](http://www.aurelienribon.com/blog/projects/universal-tween-engine/) was used for animations.
